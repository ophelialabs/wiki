# Getting Started

Here's how to get started with using and contributing to the wiki.

## Finding Information

You can find information in a few ways:

*   **Browse the article list:** The left sidebar contains a list of all articles.
*   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top of the page to search for articles by title.

## Creating New Pages

To create a new page, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new Markdown file (e.g., `my-new-article.md`) in the `docs` directory.
2.  Add your content to the file using Markdown syntax.
3.  Run the `node update-articles.js` command in your terminal to update the article list.

# Style Guide

This page outlines the style guide for writing articles in the wiki.

## Headings

Use headings to structure your articles. Start with a `#` for the main title, followed by `##` for major sections, and `###` for subsections.

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks. For example:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
