Advanced/Professional-Level Python Projects
Python enables the extraction of valuable data from websites and the automation of data collection processes. These advanced Web Scraping projects are used for multiple tasks.

Projects such as Scrape Data from Google Maps, and Automated Trading provide practical applications of these skills. The most complex projects require data scraping from dynamic platforms such as “Google Maps”, “Reddit” and use “Tweepy” to extract tweets and conduct Air Quality Index predictions.

The projects teach students to master web scraping methods and master tools that include Scrapy and OpenCV along with other Python libraries.
