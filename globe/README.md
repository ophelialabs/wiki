    Focuses on providing daily, high-resolution satellite images, offering a much more current view of Earth than Google Earth's typically older images. 

Nearmap / TerraServer / Maxar (formerly DigitalGlobe):
Historical satellite imagery providers that can be useful for specific timeframes and high-resolution needs.

For live and up-to-date satellite imagery

    Zoom Earth: Offers near real-time satellite views that are updated every 10â€“15 minutes. It pulls imagery from weather satellites operated by organizations like NOAA and provides instant updates on weather, storms, and wildfires.
    NASA Worldview: This app from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) allows for interactive browsing of full-resolution imagery in near real-time, often within three hours of retrieval. It is especially useful for tracking environmental events.
    SkyFi: A platform that offers on-demand satellite images. Unlike Google Earth's archival imagery, SkyFi provides more recent images from a variety of satellites. Users can request and purchase high-resolution images of a specific location and date.
    
For professional GIS users and researchers

    ArcGIS Earth: A downloadable application similar to Google Earth that integrates with other Esri tools. It supports 3D city views, imports various data formats, and includes professional-grade tools for analysis.
    Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem: This platform provides free access to all Sentinel satellite data from the European Space Agency (ESA). It includes optical, radar, and other data for environmental monitoring and offers powerful visualization and processing tools.
    USGS EarthExplorer: The U.S. Geological Survey offers a vast catalog of free satellite and aerial imagery, some dating back over 40 years. While not as user-friendly for amateurs, it's an excellent resource for researchers needing a variety of space-derived data.
    EOSDA LandViewer: A GIS database that provides free access to current and historical satellite imagery, along with analytical tools. It is popular among GIS experts and beginners in fields like agriculture and environmental protection. 
    
For crowd-sourced and open-source mapping

    OpenStreetMap (OSM): A collaborative, open-source project that creates a free, editable world map. It relies on a global community of mappers and is an excellent alternative to proprietary map data.
    Mapillary: This platform makes street-level images and map data available by using crowdsourced imagery from users. The images are licensed under a Creative Commons license, providing a community-driven alternative to Google Street View.
    QGIS: A free and open-source desktop Geographic Information System (GIS) application that supports viewing, editing, and analyzing geospatial data.
    
For general use and navigation

    Apple Maps: A standard option for Apple device users that offers 3D maps and a "Look Around" feature for street-level views in some areas.
    HERE WeGo: Formerly known as HERE Maps, this app is a solid alternative to Google Maps for general navigation. It provides features like offline maps, route planning, and public transit information.
    Mapbox: A popular mapping platform for developers that offers customizable maps and navigation. Its satellite imagery is often sourced from the same providers as other mapping services.
