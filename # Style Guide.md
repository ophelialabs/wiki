# Style Guide

This page outlines the style guide for writing articles in the wiki.

## Headings

Use headings to structure your articles. Start with a `#` for the main title, followed by `##` for major sections, and `###` for subsections.

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to create code blocks. For example:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
